Steam description transliterated from `steam.bbcode` by [our release script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stellaris-mods/scripts/master/stlrel).

## **Tinyifies the list of buildings available for construction on planets\!**
100% compatible with 1080/1440 addons, and all addons that add buildings, basically\.

**_I do not actually play Stellaris, I only make mods\. That is how I have fun\. Since I do not actually play, I have no idea what would best for you\. Please give me written feedback\._**

Alphamod works fine as you can see in the screenshot above :\-)

Note that the addon removes the building costs from the list\. All costs are shown in the tooltip when you hover over an entry in the list\.

Check out my mod list for addons that tinyify the ship construction list, spaceport module construction, and outliner planet list\.

\\o/ Scrolling = dead\!
